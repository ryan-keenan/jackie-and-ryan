                        Jackie is detail oriented. Ryan sometimes has on socks that don't match. Jackie is a thoughtful planner. Ryan has vegetables growing in his garden that he didn't even plant there.

                        But we have some things in common too! We met in a climbing gym in Reno, NV. It was the height of the pandemic - November 2020 - so we had our masks on, but managed to make a connection. We had both moved to Reno recently as newly remote tech workers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years since then we have been on adventures around lake Tahoe and the eastern Sierra, up and down the west coast, Minnesota, where Ryan is from, and abroad to Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, and Korea. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Five years on now we have fully settled in Reno with a flock of chickens. In the summer, we enjoy mountain biking and playing in the river. And in the winter, cross-country skiing. Come visit us sometime!
